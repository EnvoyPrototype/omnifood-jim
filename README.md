Omnifood Website

OVERVIEW:
This website is a project for a fictional company called Omnifood. I worked through it to learn the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, basic JavaScript functionality, and web design principles (color, typography, and other visual elements). 

FEATURES:
This website is mobile responsive with CSS media queries.

It also uses JavaScript for:
- mobile navigation
- smooth scrolling
- sticky navigation
- and to fix potential compatibility issues with flexbox gap in the Safari browser.

RUNNING:
Download the files and run locally or see the live link at: https://omnifood-jim.netlify.app/ 

Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS was the source of learning material for this project.
